>## LockSupport介绍
LockSupport是用来创建锁和其他同步类的基本线程阻塞原语。       
LockSupport中的park() 和 unpark() 的作用分别是阻塞线程和解除阻塞线程，而且park()和unpark()不会遇到“Thread.suspend 和 Thread.resume所可能引发的死锁”问题。    
因为park() 和 unpark()有许可的存在；调用 park() 的线程和另一个试图将其 unpark() 的线程之间的竞争将保持活性。    

 

>## LockSupport函数列表
```
// 返回提供给最近一次尚未解除阻塞的 park 方法调用的 blocker 对象，如果该调用不受阻塞，则返回 null。
static Object getBlocker(Thread t)
// 为了线程调度，禁用当前线程，除非许可可用。
static void park()
// 为了线程调度，在许可可用之前禁用当前线程。
static void park(Object blocker)
// 为了线程调度禁用当前线程，最多等待指定的等待时间，除非许可可用。
static void parkNanos(long nanos)
// 为了线程调度，在许可可用前禁用当前线程，并最多等待指定的等待时间。
static void parkNanos(Object blocker, long nanos)
// 为了线程调度，在指定的时限前禁用当前线程，除非许可可用。
static void parkUntil(long deadline)
// 为了线程调度，在指定的时限前禁用当前线程，除非许可可用。
static void parkUntil(Object blocker, long deadline)
// 如果给定线程的许可尚不可用，则使其可用。
static void unpark(Thread thread)
```

/**
 * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
 * synchronization classes.
 *
 * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
 * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
 * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
 * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
 * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
 * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
 * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
 *
 * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
 * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
 * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
 * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
 * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
 * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
 * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
 * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
 * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
 * reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
 * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
 * optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
 * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
 * effective.
 *
 * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
 * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
 * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
 * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
 * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these
 * forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is
 * strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a
 * {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
 *
 * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
 * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
 * useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}
 * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
 * <pre>while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }</pre>
 * where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
 * call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
 * permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of
 * {@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
 * non-reentrant lock class:
 * <pre>{@code
 * class FIFOMutex {
 *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters
 *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();
 *
 *   public void lock() {
 *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
 *     Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
 *     waiters.add(current);
 *
 *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
 *     while (waiters.peek() != current ||
 *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
 *        LockSupport.park(this);
 *        if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
 *          wasInterrupted = true;
 *     }
 *
 *     waiters.remove();
 *     if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
 *        current.interrupt();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void unlock() {
 *     locked.set(false);
 *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
 *   }
 * }}</pre>

说明：LockSupport是通过调用Unsafe函数中的接口实现阻塞和解除阻塞的。

 

>## LockSupport示例
对比下面的“示例1”和“示例2”可以更清晰的了解LockSupport的用法。

**示例1**

```
public class WaitTest1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ThreadA ta = new ThreadA("ta");

        synchronized(ta) { // 通过synchronized(ta)获取“对象ta的同步锁”
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" start ta");
                ta.start();

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" block");
                // 主线程等待
                ta.wait();

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" continue");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    static class ThreadA extends Thread{

        public ThreadA(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        public void run() {
            synchronized (this) { // 通过synchronized(this)获取“当前对象的同步锁”
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" wakup others");
                notify();    // 唤醒“当前对象上的等待线程”
            }
        }
    }
}
```
 

示例2

```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport;

public class LockSupportTest1 {

    private static Thread mainThread;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ThreadA ta = new ThreadA("ta");
        // 获取主线程
        mainThread = Thread.currentThread();

        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" start ta");
        ta.start();

        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" block");
        // 主线程阻塞
        LockSupport.park(mainThread);

        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" continue");
    }

    static class ThreadA extends Thread{

        public ThreadA(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        public void run() {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" wakup others");
            // 唤醒“主线程”
            LockSupport.unpark(mainThread);
        }
    }
}
```
运行结果：
```
main start ta
main block
ta wakup others
main continue
```
说明：park和wait的区别。wait让线程阻塞前，必须通过synchronized获取同步锁。
