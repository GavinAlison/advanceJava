>## ReadWriteLock 和 ReentrantReadWriteLock介绍
ReadWriteLock，顾名思义，是读写锁。它维护了一对相关的锁 — — “读取锁”和“写入锁”，一个用于读取操作，另一个用于写入操作。
-   “读取锁”用于只读操作，它是“共享锁”，能同时被多个线程获取。
-   “写入锁”用于写入操作，它是“独占锁”，写入锁只能被一个线程锁获取。
注意：不能同时存在读取锁和写入锁！    
ReadWriteLock是一个接口。ReentrantReadWriteLock是它的实现类，
ReentrantReadWriteLock包括子类ReadLock和WriteLock。

 

>## ReadWriteLock 和 ReentrantReadWriteLock函数列表

##### ReadWriteLock函数列表
```
// 返回用于读取操作的锁。
Lock readLock()
// 返回用于写入操作的锁。
Lock writeLock()
```

#####  ReentrantReadWriteLock函数列表

```
// 创建一个新的 ReentrantReadWriteLock，默认是采用“非公平策略”。
ReentrantReadWriteLock()
// 创建一个新的 ReentrantReadWriteLock，fair是“公平策略”。fair为true，意味着公平策略；否则，意味着非公平策略。
ReentrantReadWriteLock(boolean fair)

// 返回当前拥有写入锁的线程，如果没有这样的线程，则返回 null。
protected Thread getOwner()
// 返回一个 collection，它包含可能正在等待获取读取锁的线程。
protected Collection<Thread> getQueuedReaderThreads()
// 返回一个 collection，它包含可能正在等待获取读取或写入锁的线程。
protected Collection<Thread> getQueuedThreads()
// 返回一个 collection，它包含可能正在等待获取写入锁的线程。
protected Collection<Thread> getQueuedWriterThreads()

boolean hasWaiters(Condition condition)
// 如果此锁将公平性设置为 ture，则返回 true。
boolean isFair()
// 查询是否某个线程保持了写入锁。
boolean isWriteLocked()
// 查询当前线程是否保持了写入锁。
boolean isWriteLockedByCurrentThread()
// 返回用于读取操作的锁。
ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock readLock()
// 返回用于写入操作的锁。
ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock writeLock()
```
 

>## ReentrantReadWriteLock数据结构
ReentrantReadWriteLock的UML类图如下：
![lock08](test/resource/lock08.png)

从中可以看出：
```
(01) ReentrantReadWriteLock实现了ReadWriteLock接口。ReadWriteLock是一个读写锁的接口，提供了"获取读锁的readLock()函数" 和 "获取写锁的writeLock()函数"。
(02) ReentrantReadWriteLock中包含：sync对象，读锁readerLock和写锁writerLock。读锁ReadLock和写锁WriteLock都实现了Lock接口。读锁ReadLock和写锁WriteLock中也都分别包含了"Sync对象"，它们的Sync对象和ReentrantReadWriteLock的Sync对象 是一样的，就是通过sync，读锁和写锁实现了对同一个对象的访问。
(03) 和"ReentrantLock"一样，sync是Sync类型；而且，Sync也是一个继承于AQS的抽象类。Sync也包括"公平锁"FairSync和"非公平锁"NonfairSync。sync对象是"FairSync"和"NonfairSync"中的一个，默认是"NonfairSync"。
```

/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * <p>This class has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
 *
 * <p> This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
 * ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> policy.
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b><i>Non-fair mode (default)</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
 * to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 * constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may
 * indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 * will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
 * <p>
 *
 * <dt><b><i>Fair mode</i></b>
 * <dd> When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
 * approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
 * is released either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
 * be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
 * waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
 * writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
 * after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
 * released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
 * its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
 * in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
 * implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
 * {@link ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
 * do not honor this fair setting and will acquire the lock if it is
 * possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
 * <p>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
 *
 * <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 * readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 * thread have been released.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 * when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 * write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
 * <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * <b>not</b> possible.
 *
 * <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
 * <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
 * <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 *
 * <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
 * <p>This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
 * lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
 * particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
 * fashion):
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *        // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
 *        rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *        rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *        try {
 *          // Recheck state because another thread might have
 *          // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
 *          if (!cacheValid) {
 *            data = ...
 *            cacheValid = true;
 *          }
 *          // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
 *          rwl.readLock().lock();
 *        } finally {
 *          rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
 *        }
 *     }
 *
 *     try {
 *       use(data);
 *     } finally {
 *       rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class RWDictionary {
 *    private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
 *    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *    private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *    private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *    public Data get(String key) {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.get(key); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public String[] allKeys() {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { return m.put(key, value); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public void clear() {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { m.clear(); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 * and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 *
 * @since 1.5

/**
 * Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
 * synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
 * first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues.  This class is designed to
 * be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
 * single atomic <tt>int</tt> value to represent state. Subclasses
 * must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
 * define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
 * or released.  Given these, the other methods in this class carry
 * out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
 * other state fields, but only the atomically updated <tt>int</tt>
 * value manipulated using methods {@link #getState}, {@link
 * #setState} and {@link #compareAndSetState} is tracked with respect
 * to synchronization.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
 * classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
 * of their enclosing class.  Class
 * <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> does not implement any
 * synchronization interface.  Instead it defines methods such as
 * {@link #acquireInterruptibly} that can be invoked as
 * appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
 * implement their public methods.
 *
 * <p>This class supports either or both a default <em>exclusive</em>
 * mode and a <em>shared</em> mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
 * attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
 * acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
 * does not &quot;understand&quot; these differences except in the
 * mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
 * waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
 * acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
 * same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
 * one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
 * {@link ReadWriteLock}. Subclasses that support only exclusive or
 * only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.
 *
 * <p>This class defines a nested {@link ConditionObject} class that
 * can be used as a {@link Condition} implementation by subclasses
 * supporting exclusive mode for which method {@link
 * #isHeldExclusively} reports whether synchronization is exclusively
 * held with respect to the current thread, method {@link #release}
 * invoked with the current {@link #getState} value fully releases
 * this object, and {@link #acquire}, given this saved state value,
 * eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state.  No
 * <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> method otherwise creates such a
 * condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it.  The
 * behavior of {@link ConditionObject} depends of course on the
 * semantics of its synchronizer implementation.
 *
 * <p>This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
 * methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
 * condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
 * using an <tt>AbstractQueuedSynchronizer</tt> for their
 * synchronization mechanics.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
 * integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
 * thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
 * define a <tt>readObject</tt> method that restores this to a known
 * initial state upon deserialization.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
 * following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
 * the synchronization state using {@link #getState}, {@link
 * #setState} and/or {@link #compareAndSetState}:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #tryAcquire}
 * <li> {@link #tryRelease}
 * <li> {@link #tryAcquireShared}
 * <li> {@link #tryReleaseShared}
 * <li> {@link #isHeldExclusively}
 *</ul>
 *
 * Each of these methods by default throws {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException}.  Implementations of these methods
 * must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
 * not block. Defining these methods is the <em>only</em> supported
 * means of using this class. All other methods are declared
 * <tt>final</tt> because they cannot be independently varied.
 *
 * <p>You may also find the inherited methods from {@link
 * AbstractOwnableSynchronizer} useful to keep track of the thread
 * owning an exclusive synchronizer.  You are encouraged to use them
 * -- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
 * determining which threads hold locks.
 *
 * <p>Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
 * does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies.  The core
 * of exclusive synchronization takes the form:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Acquire:
 *     while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
 *        <em>enqueue thread if it is not already queued</em>;
 *        <em>possibly block current thread</em>;
 *     }
 *
 * Release:
 *     if (tryRelease(arg))
 *        <em>unblock the first queued thread</em>;
 * </pre>
 *
 * (Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)
 *
 * <p><a name="barging">Because checks in acquire are invoked before
 * enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may <em>barge</em> ahead of
 * others that are blocked and queued.  However, you can, if desired,
 * define <tt>tryAcquire</tt> and/or <tt>tryAcquireShared</tt> to
 * disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
 * methods, thereby providing a <em>fair</em> FIFO acquisition order.
 * In particular, most fair synchronizers can define <tt>tryAcquire</tt>
 * to return <tt>false</tt> if {@link #hasQueuedPredecessors} (a method
 * specifically designed to be used by fair synchronizers) returns
 * <tt>true</tt>.  Other variations are possible.
 *
 * <p>Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
 * default barging (also known as <em>greedy</em>,
 * <em>renouncement</em>, and <em>convoy-avoidance</em>) strategy.
 * While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
 * queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
 * threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
 * against incoming threads.  Also, while acquires do not
 * &quot;spin&quot; in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
 * invocations of <tt>tryAcquire</tt> interspersed with other
 * computations before blocking.  This gives most of the benefits of
 * spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
 * most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
 * augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
 * "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended}
 * and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer
 * is likely not to be contended.
 *
 * <p>This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
 * synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
 * synchronizers that can rely on <tt>int</tt> state, acquire, and
 * release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
 * not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic atomic} classes, your own custom
 * {@link java.util.Queue} classes, and {@link LockSupport} blocking
 * support.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 *
 * <p>Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
 * the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
 * represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
 * does not strictly require recording of the current owner
 * thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
 * It also supports conditions and exposes
 * one of the instrumentation methods:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {
 *
 *   // Our internal helper class
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     // Report whether in locked state
 *     protected boolean isHeldExclusively() {
 *       return getState() == 1;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Acquire the lock if state is zero
 *     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
 *       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
 *         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
 *         return true;
 *       }
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Release the lock by setting state to zero
 *     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
 *       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
 *       if (getState() == 0) throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
 *       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
 *       setState(0);
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Provide a Condition
 *     Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); }
 *
 *     // Deserialize properly
 *     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
 *         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
 *       s.defaultReadObject();
 *       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *
 *   public void lock()                { sync.acquire(1); }
 *   public boolean tryLock()          { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
 *   public void unlock()              { sync.release(1); }
 *   public Condition newCondition()   { return sync.newCondition(); }
 *   public boolean isLocked()         { return sync.isHeldExclusively(); }
 *   public boolean hasQueuedThreads() { return sync.hasQueuedThreads(); }
 *   public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
 *     sync.acquireInterruptibly(1);
 *   }
 *   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Here is a latch class that is like a {@link CountDownLatch}
 * except that it only requires a single <tt>signal</tt> to
 * fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the <tt>shared</tt>
 * acquire and release methods.
 *
 * <pre>
 * class BooleanLatch {
 *
 *   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
 *     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }
 *
 *     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
 *       return isSignalled() ? 1 : -1;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
 *       setState(1);
 *       return true;
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
 *   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
 *   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
 *   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
 *     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
 *   }
 * }

     * Wait queue node class.
     *
     * <p>The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
     * Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
     * spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
     * use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
     * information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
     * "status" field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
     * should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
     * releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
     * specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
     * thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
     * granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
     * first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
     * it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
     * contender thread may need to rewait.
     *
     * <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
     * tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
     * <pre>
     *      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
     * head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
     *      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
     * operation on "tail", so there is a simple atomic point of
     * demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeing
     * involves only updating the "head". However, it takes a bit
     * more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
     * in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
     * and interrupts.
     *
     * <p>The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
     * needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
     * successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
     * predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
     * of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
     *
     * <p>We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.
     * The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
     * predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
     * next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
     * successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
     * the "next" fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
     * when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
     * updated "tail" when a node's successor appears to be null.
     * (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
     * so that we don't usually need a backward scan.)
     *
     * <p>Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
     * algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
     * nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
     * ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
     * successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
     * a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
     * predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
     *
     * <p>CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
     * we don't create them on construction, because it would be wasted
     * effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
     * is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
     * contention.
     *
     * <p>Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
     * use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
     * in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
     * only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
     * inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
     * transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
     * field is used to mark which queue a node is on.
     *
     * <p>Thanks go to Dave Dice, Mark Moir, Victor Luchangco, Bill
     * Scherer and Michael Scott, along with members of JSR-166
     * expert group, for helpful ideas, discussions, and critiques
     * on the design of this class.

    private final Sync sync;

    protected ReadLock(ReentrantReadWriteLock lock) {
        sync = lock.sync;
    }

    // 获取“共享锁”
    public void lock() {
        sync.acquireShared(1);
    }

    // 如果线程是中断状态，则抛出一场，否则尝试获取共享锁。

    }

            "[Read locks = " + r + "]";
    }
}
```
说明：
ReadLock中的sync是一个Sync对象，Sync继承于AQS类，即Sync就是一个锁。ReentrantReadWriteLock中也有一个Sync对象，而且ReadLock中的sync和ReentrantReadWriteLock中的sync是对应关系。即ReentrantReadWriteLock和ReadLock共享同一个AQS对象，共享同一把锁。
ReentrantReadWriteLock中Sync的定义如下：
```
final Sync sync;
```
下面，分别从“获取共享锁”和“释放共享锁”两个方面对共享锁进行说明。

 

>## 获取共享锁
获取共享锁的思想(即lock函数的步骤)，是先通过tryAcquireShared()尝试获取共享锁。尝试成功的话，则直接返回；尝试失败的话，则通过doAcquireShared()不断的循环并尝试获取锁，若有需要，则阻塞等待。doAcquireShared()在循环中每次尝试获取锁时，都是通过tryAcquireShared()来进行尝试的。下面看看“获取共享锁”的详细流程。

**1. lock()**

lock()在ReadLock中，源码如下：
```
public void lock() {
    sync.acquireShared(1);
}
 ```

**2. acquireShared()**

Sync继承于AQS，acquireShared()定义在AQS中。源码如下：
```
public final void acquireShared(int arg) {
    if (tryAcquireShared(arg) < 0)
        doAcquireShared(arg);
}

说明：acquireShared()首先会通过tryAcquireShared()来尝试获取锁。
尝试成功的话，则不再做任何动作(因为已经成功获取到锁了)。
尝试失败的话，则通过doAcquireShared()来获取锁。doAcquireShared()会获取到锁了才返回。
```
 

**3. tryAcquireShared()**

tryAcquireShared()定义在ReentrantReadWriteLock.java的Sync中，源码如下：

```
protected final int tryAcquireShared(int unused) {
    Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    // 获取“锁”的状态
    int c = getState();
    // 如果“锁”是“互斥锁”，并且获取锁的线程不是current线程；则返回-1。
    if (exclusiveCount(c) != 0 &&
        getExclusiveOwnerThread() != current)
        return -1;
    // 获取“读取锁”的共享计数
    int r = sharedCount(c);
    // 如果“不需要阻塞等待”，并且“读取锁”的共享计数小于MAX_COUNT；
    // 则通过CAS函数更新“锁的状态”，将“读取锁”的共享计数+1。
    if (!readerShouldBlock() &&
        r < MAX_COUNT &&
        compareAndSetState(c, c + SHARED_UNIT)) {
        // 第1次获取“读取锁”。
        if (r == 0) { 
            firstReader = current;
            firstReaderHoldCount = 1;
        // 如果想要获取锁的线程(current)是第1个获取锁(firstReader)的线程
        } else if (firstReader == current) { 
            firstReaderHoldCount++;
        } else {
            // HoldCounter是用来统计该线程获取“读取锁”的次数。
            HoldCounter rh = cachedHoldCounter;
            if (rh == null || rh.tid != current.getId())
                cachedHoldCounter = rh = readHolds.get();
            else if (rh.count == 0)
                readHolds.set(rh);
            // 将该线程获取“读取锁”的次数+1。
            rh.count++;
        }
        return 1;
    }
    return fullTryAcquireShared(current);
}
```
说明：tryAcquireShared()的作用是尝试获取“共享锁”。    
如果在尝试获取锁时，“不需要阻塞等待”并且“读取锁的共享计数小于MAX_COUNT”，    
则直接通过CAS函数更新“读取锁的共享计数”，以及将“当前线程获取读取锁的次数+1”。    
否则，通过fullTryAcquireShared()获取读取锁。    

 

**4. fullTryAcquireShared()**

fullTryAcquireShared()在ReentrantReadWriteLock中定义，源码如下：

```
final int fullTryAcquireShared(Thread current) {
    HoldCounter rh = null;
    for (;;) {
        // 获取“锁”的状态
        int c = getState();
        // 如果“锁”是“互斥锁”，并且获取锁的线程不是current线程；则返回-1。
        if (exclusiveCount(c) != 0) {
            if (getExclusiveOwnerThread() != current)
                return -1;
        // 如果“需要阻塞等待”。
        // (01) 当“需要阻塞等待”的线程是第1个获取锁的线程的话，则继续往下执行。
        // (02) 当“需要阻塞等待”的线程获取锁的次数=0时，则返回-1。
        } else if (readerShouldBlock()) {
            // 如果想要获取锁的线程(current)是第1个获取锁(firstReader)的线程
            if (firstReader == current) {
            } else {
                if (rh == null) {
                    rh = cachedHoldCounter;
                    if (rh == null || rh.tid != current.getId()) {
                        rh = readHolds.get();
                        if (rh.count == 0)
                            readHolds.remove();
                    }
                }
                // 如果当前线程获取锁的计数=0,则返回-1。
                if (rh.count == 0)
                    return -1;
            }
        }
        // 如果“不需要阻塞等待”，则获取“读取锁”的共享统计数；
        // 如果共享统计数超过MAX_COUNT，则抛出异常。
        if (sharedCount(c) == MAX_COUNT)
            throw new Error("Maximum lock count exceeded");
        // 将线程获取“读取锁”的次数+1。
        if (compareAndSetState(c, c + SHARED_UNIT)) {
            // 如果是第1次获取“读取锁”，则更新firstReader和firstReaderHoldCount。
            if (sharedCount(c) == 0) {
                firstReader = current;
                firstReaderHoldCount = 1;
            // 如果想要获取锁的线程(current)是第1个获取锁(firstReader)的线程，
            // 则将firstReaderHoldCount+1。
            } else if (firstReader == current) {
                firstReaderHoldCount++;
            } else {
                if (rh == null)
                    rh = cachedHoldCounter;
                if (rh == null || rh.tid != current.getId())
                    rh = readHolds.get();
                else if (rh.count == 0)
                    readHolds.set(rh);
                // 更新线程的获取“读取锁”的共享计数
                rh.count++;
                cachedHoldCounter = rh; // cache for release
            }
            return 1;
        }
    }
}
```
说明：fullTryAcquireShared()会根据“是否需要阻塞等待”，“读取锁的共享计数是否超过限制”等等进行处理。如果不需要阻塞等待，并且锁的共享计数没有超过限制，则通过CAS尝试获取锁，并返回1。

 

**5. doAcquireShared()**

doAcquireShared()定义在AQS函数中，源码如下：

```
private void doAcquireShared(int arg) {
    // addWaiter(Node.SHARED)的作用是，创建“当前线程”对应的节点，并将该线程添加到CLH队列中。
    final Node node = addWaiter(Node.SHARED);
    boolean failed = true;
    try {
        boolean interrupted = false;
        for (;;) {
            // 获取“node”的前一节点
            final Node p = node.predecessor();
            // 如果“当前线程”是CLH队列的表头，则尝试获取共享锁。
            if (p == head) {
                int r = tryAcquireShared(arg);
                if (r >= 0) {
                    setHeadAndPropagate(node, r);
                    p.next = null; // help GC
                    if (interrupted)
                        selfInterrupt();
                    failed = false;
                    return;
                }
            }
            // 如果“当前线程”不是CLH队列的表头，则通过shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire()判断是否需要等待，
            // 需要的话，则通过parkAndCheckInterrupt()进行阻塞等待。若阻塞等待过程中，线程被中断过，则设置interrupted为true。
            if (shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(p, node) &&
                parkAndCheckInterrupt())
                interrupted = true;
        }
    } finally {
        if (failed)
            cancelAcquire(node);
    }
}
```
说明：doAcquireShared()的作用是获取共享锁。        
它会首先创建线程对应的CLH队列的节点，然后将该节点添加到CLH队列中。CLH队列是管理获取锁的等待线程的队列。    
如果“当前线程”是CLH队列的表头，则尝试获取共享锁；否则，则需要通过shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire()判断是否阻塞等待，需要的话，则通过parkAndCheckInterrupt()进行阻塞等待。    
doAcquireShared()会通过for循环，不断的进行上面的操作；目的就是获取共享锁。需要注意的是：doAcquireShared()在每一次尝试获取锁时，是通过tryAcquireShared()来执行的！    

shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(), parkAndCheckInterrupt()等函数已经在“Java多线程系列--“JUC锁”03之 公平锁(一) ”中详细介绍过，这里就不再重复说明了。



>## 释放共享锁
释放共享锁的思想，是先通过tryReleaseShared()尝试释放共享锁。尝试成功的话，则通过doReleaseShared()唤醒“其他等待获取共享锁的线程”，并返回true；否则的话，返回flase。

**1. unlock()**

public  void unlock() {
    sync.releaseShared(1);
}
说明：该函数实际上调用releaseShared(1)释放共享锁。

 

**2. releaseShared()**

releaseShared()在AQS中实现，源码如下：

```
public final boolean releaseShared(int arg) {
    if (tryReleaseShared(arg)) {
        doReleaseShared();
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
说明：releaseShared()的目的是让当前线程释放它所持有的共享锁。   
它首先会通过tryReleaseShared()去尝试释放共享锁。    
尝试成功，则直接返回；尝试失败，则通过doReleaseShared()去释放共享锁。    

 

**3. tryReleaseShared()**

tryReleaseShared()定义在ReentrantReadWriteLock中，源码如下：

```
protected final boolean tryReleaseShared(int unused) {
    // 获取当前线程，即释放共享锁的线程。
    Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    // 如果想要释放锁的线程(current)是第1个获取锁(firstReader)的线程，
    // 并且“第1个获取锁的线程获取锁的次数”=1，则设置firstReader为null；
    // 否则，将“第1个获取锁的线程的获取次数”-1。
    if (firstReader == current) {
        // assert firstReaderHoldCount > 0;
        if (firstReaderHoldCount == 1)
            firstReader = null;
        else
            firstReaderHoldCount--;
    // 获取rh对象，并更新“当前线程获取锁的信息”。
    } else {
 
        HoldCounter rh = cachedHoldCounter;
        if (rh == null || rh.tid != current.getId())
            rh = readHolds.get();
        int count = rh.count;
        if (count <= 1) {
            readHolds.remove();
            if (count <= 0)
                throw unmatchedUnlockException();
        }
        --rh.count;
    }
    for (;;) {
        // 获取锁的状态
        int c = getState();
        // 将锁的获取次数-1。
        int nextc = c - SHARED_UNIT;
        // 通过CAS更新锁的状态。
        if (compareAndSetState(c, nextc))
            return nextc == 0;
    }
}
```
说明：tryReleaseShared()的作用是尝试释放共享锁。

 

**4. doReleaseShared()**

doReleaseShared()定义在AQS中，源码如下：

```
private void doReleaseShared() {
    for (;;) {
        // 获取CLH队列的头节点
        Node h = head;
        // 如果头节点不为null，并且头节点不等于tail节点。
        if (h != null && h != tail) {
            // 获取头节点对应的线程的状态
            int ws = h.waitStatus;
            // 如果头节点对应的线程是SIGNAL状态，则意味着“头节点的下一个节点所对应的线程”需要被unpark唤醒。
            if (ws == Node.SIGNAL) {
                // 设置“头节点对应的线程状态”为空状态。失败的话，则继续循环。
                if (!compareAndSetWaitStatus(h, Node.SIGNAL, 0))
                    continue;
                // 唤醒“头节点的下一个节点所对应的线程”。
                unparkSuccessor(h);
            }
            // 如果头节点对应的线程是空状态，则设置“文件点对应的线程所拥有的共享锁”为其它线程获取锁的空状态。
            else if (ws == 0 &&
                     !compareAndSetWaitStatus(h, 0, Node.PROPAGATE))
                continue;                // loop on failed CAS
        }
        // 如果头节点发生变化，则继续循环。否则，退出循环。
        if (h == head)                   // loop if head changed
            break;
    }
}
```
说明：doReleaseShared()会释放“共享锁”。它会从前往后的遍历CLH队列，依次“唤醒”然后“执行”队列中每个节点对应的线程；最终的目的是让这些线程释放它们所持有的锁。

 

>## 公平共享锁和非公平共享锁
和互斥锁ReentrantLock一样，ReadLock也分为公平锁和非公平锁。

公平锁和非公平锁的区别，体现在判断是否需要阻塞的函数readerShouldBlock()是不同的。    
公平锁的readerShouldBlock()的源码如下：
```
final boolean readerShouldBlock() {
    return hasQueuedPredecessors();
}
```

在公平共享锁中，如果在当前线程的前面有其他线程在等待获取共享锁，则返回true；否则，返回false。    
非公平锁的readerShouldBlock()的源码如下：
```
final boolean readerShouldBlock() {
    return apparentlyFirstQueuedIsExclusive();
}
```
在非公平共享锁中，它会无视当前线程的前面是否有其他线程在等待获取共享锁。
只要该非公平共享锁对应的线程不为null，则返回true。

 

>##  ReentrantReadWriteLock示例
```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock; 
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock; 

public class ReadWriteLockTest1 { 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // 创建账户
        MyCount myCount = new MyCount("4238920615242830", 10000); 
        // 创建用户，并指定账户
        User user = new User("Tommy", myCount); 

        // 分别启动3个“读取账户金钱”的线程 和 3个“设置账户金钱”的线程
        for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
            user.getCash();
            user.setCash((i+1)*1000);
        }
    } 
} 

class User {
    private String name;            //用户名 
    private MyCount myCount;        //所要操作的账户 
    private ReadWriteLock myLock;   //执行操作所需的锁对象 

    User(String name, MyCount myCount) {

        this.myLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    }

    public void getCash() {
        new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                myLock.readLock().lock(); 
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" getCash start"); 
                    myCount.getCash();
                    Thread.sleep(1);
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" getCash end"); 
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                } finally {
                    myLock.readLock().unlock(); 
                }
            }
        }.start();
    }

    public void setCash(final int cash) {
        new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                myLock.writeLock().lock(); 
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" setCash start"); 
                    myCount.setCash(cash);
                    Thread.sleep(1);
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" setCash end"); 
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                } finally {
                    myLock.writeLock().unlock(); 
                }
            }
        }.start();
    }
}

class MyCount {
    private String id;         //账号 
    private int    cash;       //账户余额 

    MyCount(String id, int cash) { 
        this.id = id; 
        this.cash = cash; 
    } 

    public String getId() { 
        return id; 
    } 

    public void setId(String id) { 
        this.id = id; 
    } 

    public int getCash() { 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" getCash cash="+ cash); 
        return cash; 
    } 

    public void setCash(int cash) { 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +" setCash cash="+ cash); 
        this.cash = cash; 
    } 
}
```
运行结果：

```
Thread-0 getCash start
Thread-2 getCash start
Thread-0 getCash cash=10000
Thread-2 getCash cash=10000
Thread-0 getCash end
Thread-2 getCash end
Thread-1 setCash start
Thread-1 setCash cash=1000
Thread-1 setCash end
Thread-3 setCash start
Thread-3 setCash cash=2000
Thread-3 setCash end
Thread-4 getCash start
Thread-4 getCash cash=2000
Thread-4 getCash end
Thread-5 setCash start
Thread-5 setCash cash=3000
Thread-5 setCash end
```
结果说明：    
(01) 观察Thread0和Thread-2的运行结果，我们发现，Thread-0启动并获取到“读取锁”，在它还没运行完毕的时候，Thread-2也启动了并且也成功获取到“读取锁”。
因此，“读取锁”支持被多个线程同时获取。    
(02) 观察Thread-1,Thread-3,Thread-5这三个“写入锁”的线程。只要“写入锁”被某线程获取，则该线程运行完毕了，才释放该锁。
因此，“写入锁”不支持被多个线程同时获取。
